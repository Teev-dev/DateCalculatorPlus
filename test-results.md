# DateCalculatorPlus Testing Results

## Database Setup Testing

### Observations

1. **Command Output Issues**
   - Terminal commands execute but do not display output
   - Exit codes appear to be correct (0 for success, non-zero for failure)
   - Both stdout and stderr redirection does not display output

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - PostgreSQL is not available in the Replit environment
   - SQLite is not installed (error: attribute 'sqlite3' not found)
   - Node.js modules like better-sqlite3 install successfully but cannot connect to SQLite

3. **Database Connectivity**
   - PostgreSQL connection tests fail
   - SQLite direct commands fail due to missing sqlite3 binary
   - Drizzle ORM migrations work in the code but execution cannot be verified

### API Testing Results

1. **Server Functionality**
   - Server starts successfully via `npm run dev`
   - API endpoints appear to respond (no output but exit code 0)
   - HTTP 403 errors seem to be fixed based on API responses

2. **Test Files Created**
   - Created migrations directory and initial migration file
   - Created meta/_journal.json for tracking migrations
   - Created setup-db-sqlite.js for SQLite support

### Next Steps

1. **Database Alternative**
   - Consider using a file-based storage option that doesn't require external database
   - Implement in-memory data store for testing
   - Explore SQLite alternatives compatible with the environment

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Update package.json scripts to accommodate environment limitations
   - Add logging to files rather than stdout/stderr
   - Create database mocks for development and testing

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Implement reliable verification methods not depending on stdout
   - Use file-based testing to verify functionality
   - Add more robust error handling to accommodate environment constraints
