Implementation Strategy for OpenHolidays API
API Integration
Use the OpenHolidays API endpoints to fetch holiday data
Main endpoints to use:
/Countries for supported countries
/PublicHolidays for public holidays
/SchoolHolidays for school holidays (if needed)
Data Retrieval
Fetch the list of supported countries when the plugin initializes
Retrieve holiday data on-demand or pre-fetch for better performance
Use the appropriate ISO 3166-1 country codes in your requests
Data Storage
Store the list of supported countries in the plugin's local storage
Cache holiday data using Chrome's storage API or IndexedDB for offline access and to reduce API calls
User Interface
Allow users to select their country from the supported list
Implement a date picker or calendar view to display holidays
Holiday Data Handling
Parse the JSON response from the API
Handle both public and school holidays if required
Display holiday names in the user's preferred language (API supports multiple languages)
API Request Management
Implement error handling for API requests
Add a retry mechanism for failed requests
Respect API usage limits and implement appropriate throttling
Date Range Handling
The API allows querying holidays for a specific date range
Implement logic to fetch holidays for the current year or a user-defined period
Ensure the date range doesn't exceed the API's three-year limit
Localization
Use the /Languages endpoint to fetch available languages
Allow users to select their preferred language for holiday names
Subdivision Support
For countries with subdivisions, use the /Subdivisions endpoint
Allow users to select relevant subdivisions for more accurate holiday data
Performance Optimization
Implement caching to store holiday data locally
Update cached data periodically (e.g., once a day or week)
Optional iCal Integration
Offer an option to export holidays in iCal format using the API's iCal response option
Regular Updates
Implement a mechanism to periodically check for updates to the country list and holiday data
User Customization
Allow users to add custom holidays or modify existing ones for personal use
Timezone Handling
Ensure correct display of holidays based on the user's timezone
